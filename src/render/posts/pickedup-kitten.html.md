A pet's worst nightmare is the owner.

Well, some owners do well. I sure as hell don't. But I ain't no evil who want to cast misery upon poor animals. I just suck at raising living things. Let me share with you a story.

A notorious sister of mine loves to buy pets and totally not clean up after them, therefore making us family members work. So, we ended up rearing a ferret, cats and dogs, various birds, lots of hamsters, and a spectrum of aquatics. Most of them either fated to premature death or runaway. I might add that absolutely no animal cruelty existed; only did idiocy.

For example, out of the blue our hamster started twitching insanely like a scene in a horror movie and dropped dead. This happened back in high school years. We held it in our hands and rubbed, as if that would magically revive it. My sister wept all night. The cause of death was quite mysterious except in hindsight, I had sprayed and wiped the floor with a cleaner product an hour before the incident, and the hamster cage was near it… hmm.

When I was 6, I fed a baby sparrow using a syringe, applied too much pressure, and tiny grains bursted open its furry throat. *Pop!* Oops. That was a trippy moment. Yellow grains oozed out from somewhere they were't supposed to.

When I was 12, my family loved our Betta fish so much that we built a pond in the backyard. A wild duck ate it the following day. Has a good intention ever gone wrong?

And then there were Rollie the ferret, Sally the dog, and... you know what, let’s stop any further exposé of my shameful display here to be kind to you and stay on track with the story because in fact, I have endless supply of them. But that’s not the point.

All the failures aside, time has passed and I joined the working members of the society. I kept my athleticism up to beat that beer belly, which is slowly but surely getting the better of me. That’s why I was jogging uphill on my way home that day, and suddenly a faint *meow* caught my ear. I paused to pay intense attention, as anyone would have done in that situation, and there it was in the bushes, a kitten as small as my smartphone and as white as milk, helplessly trembling, one scorching summer day.

> *“When human picks up kitten, mother cat abandons it”&mdash;some dude in my brain.*

Presumably, human interaction with wild animals is no bueno. True or not, I didn’t want to carelessly approach the tiny thing and ruin its life. So I kept some distance and just gazed at it like a retard, while also trying to spot its mom. The kitten kept meowing. The kitten looked at me. Oh no, it’s limping this way. What am I supposed to do!?

Maybe the mother cat already abandoned it, or even died. I snuggled the kitten in my arms and walked home. That very moment, a wild hawk took a nose dive and hunted down a mocking bird, right in front of my face! Holy crap. That scene was the first time I saw live hunting by a hawk. Apparently, it had to happen that day, that moment. The hawk was chilling on a utility pole, crushing the prey with sharp claws. Another mocking bird, most likely the victim’s mate, fiercely tackled the hawk over and over and over again in a desperate attempt to save the partner's dear life. Usually I would appreciate such drama, but then when I’m holding a kitten, it’s totally uncalled for. Looking up the sky, there were at least a dozen more hawks. It was 5 minutes walk to get home. The longest 5 minutes of my life.

Since the kitten was obviously undernourished, I bought a bunch of Pedigree meals that looked better than my diet. Then I took it to a vet across the street. On a side note, I lived in the area for 7 years and never knew it existed. Funny how indifference leads to ignorance. Anyway, diagnosis revealed that the kitten was a 3-week-old boy who barely weaned off breastfeeding, which by the way, if that were the case, then nurturing him would have been infinitely harder.

I owned him for a month or so. During that period, my boring, empty room got filled with toy mice, cat tower, portable vacuum cleaner, cat toilet, bucket full of absorbent sand, scratch pads, bags of cat powder and food, prescription medicine from the veterinary, DSLR camera, and SD card full of cat videos.

I named him *Big Boss* because I had a terrible taste for names, and [Metal Gear Solid V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_V:_Ground_Zeroes) was just released. I printed out flyers to look for a new adopter. Why didn’t I keep Big Boss? Well, the house was my aunt’s and she had (rightfully) zero confidence in our ability to fulfill responsibility. And my track record kinda sucks when it comes to pets.

Eventually the news traveled, and my ex-housemate’s relative’s friend’s daughter (and her husband) came over to take away Big Boss. I boxed up everything and told them to administer a flea repellent in a month, clip his nails if he’d be a house cat, and finish up his vaccinations. *“Are you sure you want to give him up?”* they asked, the answer to which was uncertain, but I nodded and walked them out the door.

They got in a car. Big Boss kept meowing. I acted as a tough guy but cried like a baby inside. See ya, little man.

Two years later, I am reading my diary at Starbucks. It dubiously qualifies as a diary because each entry reads like “yoga’ed this morning,” or “dad visited today,” so a more accurate description would be a *lazy one-liner daily record*. Still, somehow the great human brains can miraculouly take those inputs, trigger a chain reaction of memories, and form a full-blown story. Unfathomable.

Reading on, I got curious what the very first entry was. Why did I even start this mundane task? There must have been an incredible event that motivated me to record my life. After flipping through hundreds of pages, I finally reached the beginning.

It reads: “7/14/2014, I picked up a cat.”
