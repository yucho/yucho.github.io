If you've ever been to a driving range and smashed golf balls, you would understand the indescribable feeling to watch a white dot vanish into oblivion. Though the ball is past one hundred miles, it feels very still, as *Major Tom* puts it. It's more satisfying than Jasmine on a magic carpet ride.

The other day, my coworkers were chatting about golf. They were having a good time in the office. The folloing summarizes their entire conversation: "Have you been to *so-and-so* course?" "Did you know *so-and-so* plays well?" "Tell me about it." rinse and repeat. Eventually, one of the coworkers turned to me and asked: *"you play golf?"*

I was not sure. But I can share my view on this awe-inspiring sport.

First off, we get to own a slave during the game! Of course, we will be courteous and call it a caddie. But it basically carries luggages and drives a car for us. It rakes bumpy soil and wipes dirt off balls. That's neat.

An average golf course is 150 acre big. And golfers get to privatize everything within the land. You think moms pushing strollers can enjoy the beautiful landscape? Screw that. In order to build a golf course, the owner must invest millions of dollars to vandalize local ecosystem. He must wipe out native vegetation, drive away annoying wild animals, and infuse the soil with good stuff so only the lawn can survive. Even after all those troubles, he spends half million dollar annually to maintain them. Do you understand the prestige now, moms? You wanna walk, you gonna pay.

Now, let's hear what others have to say about this magnificent sport.

> *"You know who plays golf? Guys who are too fat to play tennis"&mdash;Eve from [Serendipity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePU2Ux9JIMM)*

Actually, Eve, that's awesome. It means golf is an undiscriminating sport that accepts those who aren't good enough for other sports. On that note, PGA lifted the ban on coloured people from playing golf in 1961. Very generous, no? That's like much later than any other sports! Golfer demographic is very likeable, too. It consists exclusively of rich men who each have ten wives.

> *"[Golf is] a boring game for boring people. Do you ever watch golf on television? It's like watching flies fuck"&mdash;[Greorge Carlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4w7H48tBS8)*

Even the legendary comic/opinion leader endorses it. Golf equals maggot-making. I am always fascinated by reproductive biology of insects.

Another reason to love this game is that there comes a serendipitous moment every time you play. Here's just one example. I was practicing my swing at a driving range one day. It was nice and sunny. Ducks were flocking on an artificial lake. Squirrels were running afar on the field. The guys next to my station were talking.

"Hey man, check this out. I'm gonna hit those squirrels with my balls."<br>
"Word. That's a good practice of aim."

What a brilliant idea. I almost wanted to turn to them and join the conversation. But since I'm a shy pussy who has a heart smaller than that of a chicken, I couldn't do it. These men just enlightened me that we possess the power to decide whether those tiny brains stay in skulls or splatter on the ground. Us big men dominate. Yeah.

Here's what I would have told them if I had the courage: "Dude, you're genius. Hold on, I got a better plan. Let's target your fucking forehead instead!"
