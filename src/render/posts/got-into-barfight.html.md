**Alter ego** &mdash; *noun* &nbsp; a person's secondary or alternative personality.

Fiction authors love the concept of alter ego. We all kind of think it is cool and mysterious because it hides behind a regular personality. But it just might not deserve all that credit. Contrary to popular belief, alter egos appear quite commonly in everyday settings.

For a start, road ragers. These peeps are decent outside vehicles. But hopping inside a moving electric box somehow makes them hate life out of nowhere.

Multilingual speakers feel a paradigm shift when they switch their spoken language. The reason is because we think in words, so by drastically changing available vocabularies, a person essentialy becomes someone else.

Perhaps the most intriguing of all is **drunk personality**. A dormant angry, happy, depressed, sleepy, or what have you will emerge as soon as some booze kicks in. I, for one, am that awkward guy in a group when sober. But with a help of little alcohol, I come out of my shell and steal the scene for the night. Granted, I am annoying when drunk. And annoyingness added to impaired decision can result in a bad, *baaad* boo-boo.

This is a story about my bad boo-boo.

Paul & Eddie's is about 7 minutes walk from my high school. It is a bar with a big neon sign up front that reads "pool and darts." But I always thought this place was a swim shop because apparently pool was for swimming according to my dysfunctional high school brain. It was years later when my friend took me to the place that I realized my idiocy.

Anyway, my friend James and I were having a blast. The bar charges a dollar per a game of eight-ball and losers pay for the game. We challenged regulars who were there, a duo of a laid-back white bloke and a huge Latino man. For the sake of storytelling, let me codename them *White* and *Brown* respectively, inspired by their skin colors.

Brown saw me and shouted "Okajima!" numerous times like an idiot, which confused me very much. I shouted back "Jose!" every time he did so, and he would burst into laugher. Intelligence level was quick to plunge, which was, of course, to be expected in a place to serve alcohol.

James and I won six games on a streak.

"You guys are sandbaggin'!" White complained. "Sandbaggers."

"Ey, I like you boys. I'll treat a shot for everyone." Brown said and opened a tab for more drinks.

"I got a bar joke." White smirked. "A stork brings a white baby. A crow brings a black baby. What bird brings no baby?"

I exerted what little is left of my intoxicated brainpower in vain. "I give up."

"It's a *swallow*. Get it?" White raised his chin, opened his mouth, and jiggled his right hand back and forth in front of it.

"He doesn't get it, ha-ha!" James locked his arm around my neck and knuckled my head. God damn James.

We continued to play pool. I said, "If you make this shot, I'm gonna **hug you**."

White gave me a blank stare, reached for his pants, and said, "I'm ready."

At this point the intelligence level had truly hit rock bottom. I was too hammered to even stand straight, but we kept playing nonetheless. No one was serious anymore, and things got out of control. Seeing all that, Brown *finally* made a move. "Brothers, this next round is a *hundred dollars per game.*"

...There couldn't have been a more obvious hustle. But being the knucklehead I am, I didn't see it. I mean, we won all 6 games. We are better players than them, right? Fortunately, James and I had no balls to bet Benjamin for a game, so we didn't accept the challenge. In fact, we were ready to sober up with some Chinese food afterwards. So we headed to the door.

Brown suddenly snapped at that moment. "Ey, I don't like your *hugging* shit, man!" He grabbed my shirt and hurled me into the floor.

I flinched backward, totally not comprehending at all what was happening. The crowd was quick to react to the scene. A few men came to stop Brown from potential misdemeanor.

White walked over and said, "Yeah, you're fucked up. Get the hell out of here." He then threw me out of the bar.

James didn't witness any of this because he was already in his car all the while. God damn James.

In retrospect, I am glad that I didn't hit back, not that I had the guts for it. Anything could have happened in the heat of the moment. Things could have turned much worse. I recall a story of my good friend's son who once turned legal age. He was 6 foot 3 tall, strong, handsome, and ready for life. He went to a bar one day, picked a fight with some cheap gangs, and got shot dead. End of the story. The incident painfully reminds me that *macho* is the root of all things bad. Tough guy can't stomach no bullet.

My bar fight experience was long ago, still to this day I think about Brown every now and then. I wonder how he is doing with life. Weird thing is that I actually wish him well, even with everything that happened. There once was a huge Latino macho-man who said he "liked me," treated me to a shot of whiskey, and then picked a fight with me. That's part of me now.

My father's words come to mind: "Remember, son." he said. "Whoever makes you drink is never your friend."
