<div>
	<p>I&#39;d never been to Europe. So I flew to Paris on Monday and took 2 weeks of French language course. At the school, I made friends much younger than myself (who is 28 at the time of writing). Seems like youngsters study abroad in this day and age.</p>
<p>The first surprise came as how they counted floors. In France, the ground level counts as 0, and the floor above is 1 (unlike in USA where the ground is 1)! Because of this, I couldn&#39;t find the classroom on the first day.</p>
<p>Also, everyone smokes in Paris. Like, everyone. Parisian soil is practically cigarette buds. Parisian breakfast is basically cigs and espresso. Also, I’ve eaten more baguettes during the trip than my previous 28 years of life.</p>
<p>In such a country full of wonder, I went to a picnic by the Eiffel Tower with new friends. One of them was a winner of men’s beauty pageant held in Japanese university, so we were watching his embarrassing contest videos as we sipped Kronenbourg 1664. Good time passed by fast. The clock turned 11pm. The glimmering light show had begun on the tower and stole everyone’s attention. Having satisfied, we were ready to go—except that my bag was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Ah, crap.</p>
<p>Precisely my first thought. I&#39;ve heard so many stories about pickpockets, thieves, and even robbers in Europe. But who would have thought that YOU would be next? I had dismissed all previous stories as lack of attention and awareness. I shouldn’t have had. It was real and now  too late. Wallet, passport, textbooks, GoPro, everything, gone.</p>
<p>I would like to think that a poor mother who&#39;s got 3 young mouths to feed, who&#39;s desperate time called for desperate measure and laid hands apologetically on my meager wealth in attempt to survive another day. But no matter how hard I tried, a smirky douchebag looking satisfied stealing possessions of the others overwrites my pitiful imagination.</p>
<p>And so followed a hectic week: borrowing money from friends; invalidating and shipping new credit/debit cards; reporting to <em>Commissaire de Police</em>; acquiring an emergency passport; contacting travel insurance; buying school supplies; etc. Having had more than enough to eat, I kissed goodbye to Paris and departed for the next destination.</p>
<p>.
.
.</p>
<p>The sun stood tall in Barcelona sky as beautiful girls laid topless in golden beaches. It was a perfect day, yet I stayed at a friend’s house to play <em>Splatoon 2</em>, a recently released video game. Seriously, the game is addicting. Please check it out if you don’t know it.</p>
<p>By the way, the floor numberings were even crazier in Spain. The ground is “B”, above it is 0, and then 1, and so on. Why do Europeans love to complicate simple things?</p>
<p>Anyway, I was playing the aforementioned video game. But then on second thought we decided that we should get our asses out, so my friend Alejandro and I drove to the Sagrada Familia. The decision was a tad bit too late, though. The gate was closed for the day.</p>
<p>Having been bummed, we sat at Costa Coffee for a break. Across from us sat a young homeless man on a sidewalk against a wall. He greeted enthusiastically at pedestrians. I hoped that he wouldn’t look at us. He then looked at us, smiled, and begged for money. Since I had nothing better to do anyway, I walked over to him, sat next to the man, and began talking. He didn’t speak English, so I asked Alejandro to translate for me.</p>
<p>“Hello, if you wouldn’t mind telling me, I want to know why you became homeless.”</p>
<p>The man then turned to Alejandro and gave a long explanation in Spanish.</p>
<p>“He said he came from Romania to find a job in Barcelona. But he can’t afford a worker VISA, so he first has to beg for money to pay for that. His dad is diabetic, so he also needs to buy medicines.”</p>
<p>I handed him what little cash I had left and turned to Alejandro.</p>
<p>“Tell him this is all I have. I got my wallet stolen in Paris, and I’m really short on cash.”</p>
<p>Again, the homeless man and Alejandro chatted for a while. He then turned to me.</p>
<p>“He said the thief who stole your bag is probably his kind of people. Many refugees who fail to find jobs in other countries end up stealing because it’s an easy way out. It takes balls to beg. You get looked down upon. You annoy people. He said he is brave enough to do it, and he apologized to you on behalf of some of his compatriots.”</p>
<p>Thus we hugged each other goodbye and drove back home.</p>
<p>That night, I thought about things that had happened: the incident that caused me so much troubles; the encounter with the homeless man; and what I learned from him. I realized that I no longer have any grudge against the thief. All I got is a sense of powerlessness over consequences that drive people into cowardly actions. I can do nothing for them, who will slowly destroy themselves from inside every time they commit a crime.</p>
<p>Just, wonderful.</p>
