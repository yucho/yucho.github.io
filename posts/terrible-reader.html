<h4><a href="/posts/terrible-reader.html">Being a Terrible Reader</a></h4>
<div>
	<p>It is fair to say that I like reading. I spent the last two weeks reading 666 chapters of <em>Ascendance of a Bookworm</em> (本好きの下剋上) in Japanese, which totals astounding 5.6 million characters! I literally did nothing but read, eat, sleep, excrete, and read. Definitely the best two weeks I had in the longest time. In the end I died, satisfied.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. today, I picked up an English book and started reading. I went through its cover, front page, acknowledgements, and preface. I turned to the clock. It was 3 p.m. Yes, a few pages of nothingness, before the book even actually begins, took me two damn hours to finish.</p>
<p>One epiphany came; a shocking realization that I am in fact a terrible reader. But hear me out! There is no question that I suck at reading, but the book was also accountable for what happened. It wasn’t only my fault. What happened was that every other paragraph infuriated me, and I had to take a breath each time. I hated the book and its author. And the rest of this article is basically me spewing hatred.</p>
<p>So, the first culprit is the <strong>acknowledgements</strong>, also known as special thanks. It is a common practice for English writers today to start off a book with acknowledgements, preface, forewords, introduction, prologue, or any combination of the above. And all writers follow more or less the same format: listing out people and offering thanks; storytelling how the book came to existence; and mentioning other literary work that influenced the author. Cool, right? No, not cool at all.</p>
<p>First of all, nobody benefits from this, not the actual people whose names were mentioned, and sure as hell not the readers. From what I understand, getting your name printed in small fonts, buried among piles of other unrelated people’s names is not honorable. Yet, what an ordeal for the rest of us to read through them, hoping to find gold nuggets of information somewhere, only to find the effort fruitless. If you disagree, I am happy for you that you are honored, in exchange for your provisions of indefatigable assistance to the author, for having your name occupy the book’s surface area that is smaller than my anal hair. Provided that you are a well-established individual, the author merely used your name for his own credibility. Either way acknowledgements are entirely self-serving.</p>
<p>“This book wouldn&#39;t have seen the light of day without the tireless editorial work of my publishing agent Jane Doe, and I cannot thank her enough.” Well, if you want to thank her enough, then print her business card on your book to help her acquire new clients. You know, show me some action. Dedicating a book to the author’s wife had somehow been a thing, even though literally dedicating anything else to her would have been better, like his time, car, or a chocolate. Or better yet, assign all royalties to her, if you really want <em>dedication</em>. Then we can talk.</p>
<p>Readers want to dive straight into advertised contents. Noone is interested in the story of the book’s birth. Please save it for the epilogue.</p>
<p>Next up is <strong>namedropping</strong>. Boy, what can I say. The scumbag&#39;s a dirt cheap credibility booster that occurs way too often in literature. Friedrich Nietzsche and George Orwell’s critical reflections on society played important roles in conceiving my analytical mindset that eventually lead to my penmanship. See how smart I am? Except I’m not.</p>
<p>“Epically breathtaking.” “Phenomenal.” These familiar sounding hyperboles are called <strong>blurbs</strong>, promotional comments praising a work of art. It seems that nothing can escape from them these days. They plague TV shows, movies, and books with <em>Whatever Times</em> and <em>So-and-So Magazine</em>. They add nothing meaningful because few sentences are never enough to summarize any artistic experience. Still, authors who desperately need others’ approvals spray their work all over with superlative quotation jizz. Insecurity prevails.</p>
<p>At this point you may be wondering why I don’t just skip to the first chapter. In fact, you are encouraged in schools to skip irrelevant passages. This is especially important in timed settings like reading tests, where you are expected to deduce what a writing is about from the first and the last sentences of each paragraph. But is it fair for me to raise the bar and expect something better from professional writers?</p>
<p>I expect writers to refine their writings. I expect writers to present important information first, then elaborate progressively. I expect that every word is there for a reason. Because that&#39;s what I do in my writings. Perhaps that’s why too many books infuriate me. There is too much utter unnecessity.</p>
<p>Everything that I complained above wouldn’t have been a problem if it were at the end of the book. But it is always at the beginning, where readers naturally turn to first. A simpleminded reader such as myself simplemindedly follows chronology of things; that is, going from start to finish. And if one million readers had wasted ten minutes, then the author is responsible for ten million minutes of precious human labor. That’s enough time to startup nine Googles. It’s nine Googles that one author destroyed thanks to his worthless preface.</p>
<p>If there will ever be a great writer, may his/her book have a clean cover consisting only of title, author, and image, no blurbs, no summary, no tag, just like good old classics.</p>
