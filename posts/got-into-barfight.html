	<p><strong>Alter ego</strong> &mdash; <em>noun</em> &nbsp; a person&#39;s secondary or alternative personality.</p>
<p>Fiction authors love the concept of alter ego. We all kind of think it is cool and mysterious because it hides behind a regular personality. But it just might not deserve all that credit. Contrary to popular belief, alter egos appear quite commonly in everyday settings.</p>
<p>For a start, road ragers. These peeps are decent outside vehicles. But hopping into a moving electric box somehow makes them hate life out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Multilingual speakers feel a paradigm shift when they switch their spoken language. The reason is because we think in words, so by drastically changing available vocabularies, a person essentialy becomes someone else.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most intriguing of all is <strong>drunk personality</strong>. A dormant angry, happy, depressed, sleepy, or what have you will emerge as soon as some booze kicks in. I, for one, am that awkward guy in a group when sober. But with a help of little alcohol, I come out of my shell and steal the scene for the night. Granted, I am annoying when drunk. And annoyingness added to impaired decision can result in a bad, <em>baaad</em> boo-boo.</p>
<p>This is a story about my bad boo-boo.</p>
<p>Paul &amp; Eddie&#39;s is about 7 minutes walk from my high school. It is a bar with a big neon sign up front that reads &quot;pool and darts.&quot; But I always thought this place was a swim shop because apparently pool was for swimming according to my dysfunctional high school brain. It was years later when my friend took me to the place that I realized my idiocy.</p>
<p>Anyway, my friend James and I were having a blast. The bar charges a dollar per a game of eight-ball and losers pay for the game. We challenged regulars who were there, a duo of a laid-back white bloke and a huge Latino man. For the sake of storytelling, let me codename them <em>White</em> and <em>Brown</em> respectively, inspired by their skin colors.</p>
<p>Brown saw me and shouted &quot;Okajima!&quot; numerous times like an idiot, which confused me very much. I shouted back &quot;Jose!&quot; every time he did so, and he would burst into laughter. Intelligence level was quick to plunge, which was, of course, to be expected in a place to serve alcohol.</p>
<p>James and I won six games on a streak.</p>
<p>&quot;You guys are sandbaggin&#39;!&quot; White complained. &quot;Sandbaggers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ey, I like you boys. I&#39;ll treat a shot for everyone.&quot; Brown said and opened a tab for more drinks.</p>
<p>&quot;I got a bar joke.&quot; White smirked. &quot;A stork brings a white baby. A crow brings a black baby. What bird brings no baby?&quot;</p>
<p>I exerted what little is left of my intoxicated brainpower in vain. &quot;I give up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a <em>swallow</em>. Get it?&quot; White raised his chin, opened his mouth, and jiggled his right hand back and forth in front of it.</p>
<p>&quot;He doesn&#39;t get it, ha-ha!&quot; James locked his arm around my neck and knuckled my head. God damn James.</p>
<p>We continued to play pool. I said, &quot;If you make this shot, I&#39;m gonna <strong>hug you</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>White gave me a blank stare, reached for his pants, and said, &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot;</p>
<p>At this point the intelligence level had truly hit rock bottom. I was too hammered to even stand straight, but we kept playing nonetheless. No one was serious anymore, and things got out of control. Seeing all that, Brown <em>finally</em> made a move. &quot;Brothers, this next round is a <em>hundred dollars per game.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>...There couldn&#39;t have been a more obvious hustle. But being the knucklehead I am, I didn&#39;t see it. I mean, we won all 6 games. We are better players than them, right? Fortunately, James and I had no balls to bet Benjamin for a game, so we didn&#39;t accept the challenge. In fact, we were ready to sober up with some Chinese food afterwards. So we headed to the door.</p>
<p>Brown suddenly snapped at that moment. &quot;Ey, I don&#39;t like your <em>hugging</em> shit, man!&quot; He grabbed me by the collar and hurled me into the floor.</p>
<p>I flinched backward, totally not comprehending at all what was happening. The crowd was quick to react to the scene. A few men came to stop Brown from potential misdemeanor.</p>
<p>White walked over and said, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re fucked up. Get the hell out of here.&quot; He then threw me out of the bar.</p>
<p>James didn&#39;t witness any of this because he was already in his car all the while. God damn James.</p>
<p>.
.
.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I am glad that I didn&#39;t hit back, not that I had the guts for it. Anything could have happened in the heat of the moment. Things could have turned much worse. I recall a story of my good friend&#39;s son who once turned legal age. He was 6 foot 3 tall, strong, handsome, and ready for life. He went to a bar one day, picked a fight with some cheap gangs, and got shot dead. End of the story. The incident painfully reminds me that <em>macho</em> is the root of all things bad. Tough guy can&#39;t stomach no bullet.</p>
<p>My bar fight experience was long ago, still to this day I think about Brown every now and then. I wonder how he is doing with life. Weird thing is that I actually wish him well, even with everything that happened. There once was a huge Latino macho-man who said he &quot;liked me,&quot; treated me to a shot of whiskey, and then picked a fight with me. That&#39;s part of me now.</p>
<p>My father&#39;s words come to mind: &quot;Remember, son.&quot; he said. &quot;Whoever makes you drink is never your friend.&quot;</p>
