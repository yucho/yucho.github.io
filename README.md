# [Astropolitan Project](http://yuchoho.com)
A very omnivorous website that talks just about anything. It also happens to be [Yucho Ho](https://github.com/yucho)'s personal showcase. This website is built on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) skeleton for [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad). For more information, please visit the respective project websites.
